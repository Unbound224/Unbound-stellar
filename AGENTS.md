# AI Coding Agent Instructions — unbound-stellar

## Mission
Implement **only the `unbound-stellar` subsystem** as defined in `docs/PROJECT_MASTER.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/SRD.md`, and `docs/TECHNICAL_BUILD.md`. The entire product is Unbound: An issuer-authorized marketplace for genuinely redeemable, transferable merchant credits. A user can receive digital store credit issued on Stellar and exchange it through native Stellar liquidity for another supported asset. The product does not magically convert an arbitrary gift card, nor promise liquidity or fiat withdrawal.

## Neighbor repositories
`unbound-mobile`, `unbound-core`, `unbound-site`. You are responsible for your own component and versioned integrations; do not duplicate their owners' logic.

## Current state (read before trusting older docs)

This repository is **built and CI-verified, not yet run against a live network**. Code, tests, docs, the
landing page and release workflows are complete and on `main`. What has never been done: deploying to Stellar
Testnet, running on real phones or with a real wallet, any security audit, any store listing, any
Drips Wave approval. Do not describe those as done. Older text in `docs/` that says the repo is only a
scaffold is superseded by `README.md` (status table) and `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Execution
1. Read all project docs and verify the **domain safety constraints** first.
2. Define your contracts with sibling repos using schema/ABI and fixtures. Agree on versioned handshake.
3. Complete M0 and M1 before style polish or unrelated new features.
4. Make small, testable commits (PRs only if the owner asks) and record architecture changes in ADRs.
5. Never pretend missing product or chain integrations are working; use clearly labeled test adapters.
6. Write real tests for system logic and failure paths, not only mocked happy paths.
7. Don't ask for production funds/credentials; use Testnet and synthetic providers.
8. Keep UI architecture flexible and let design be refined while respecting the brand's flat-icon and functional requirements.

> You are in `Unbound-stellar` (GitHub `Unbound224/Unbound-stellar`). The sections below apply to the whole Unbound project (4 repos).
> Run the runbook from the repo it names; stay inside this project's repos.

## START HERE: how to use this file

You are an AI coding agent working **on the owner's own computer** (not the cloud sandbox that built
this code). When the owner says only "read AGENTS.md", do this:

1. Read this whole file, then `docs/PROJECT_MASTER.md`, `docs/SECURITY.md`, `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`
   and `CHANGELOG.md` of the repo you are in.
2. Detect the workspace (section "Workspace layout"), fetch any missing sibling repos.
3. Run the **Local continuation runbook** below, phase by phase, in order. Do all the work you can
   do yourself. Stop and ask the owner only at the points marked **HUMAN**.
4. When the phases are done, produce the **Final checklist for the owner** (last section) with the
   real values you obtained (contract ids, URLs, hashes) filled in. That checklist is the final
   deliverable. After the owner completes it, the project is ready to submit to Drips Wave.

### Why this section exists

The code was written in a cloud sandbox with **no route to Stellar Testnet, no stellar-cli, no
Android SDK and no real wallet or phone**. Everything that needs those was written and tested
offline (unit tests, property tests, golden vectors, fake adapters) but **never run for real**.
Running it for real, fixing whatever breaks, and recording the evidence is your job.

## Truth rules (non-negotiable)

- Never claim that something works, is deployed, audited or listed unless **you ran it and saw the
  output**. Quote the command and result in your commit message or in `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`.
- Never invent a contract id, transaction hash, URL, store listing, metric, user or partner.
- If a script, command or test fails, **fix the root cause** (script flags, RPC parameters, fees,
  code) and rerun. Do not skip, delete or weaken a test to get green. Do not mark a step done on a
  partial success.
- If something cannot be done on this machine (wallet click, phone, store account), say so plainly and
  put it in the owner's checklist instead of faking it.
- Everything is **Stellar Testnet and synthetic data only**. Never use Mainnet or real funds. The
  deploy scripts refuse Mainnet; do not remove that guard.

## Secrets and safety rules

- Never commit, print, log or paste into chat any secret key, seed phrase, keystore, token, password
  or `.env` file. Use `stellar keys` **aliases** (the key stays in the local stellar-cli keystore).
  `stellar keys show <alias>` prints a secret: never run it where the output is recorded; the Sideband
  smoke script uses it only inside a pipe.
- `.env` files are gitignored. Only `.env.example` (placeholders) is committed. Before every commit run
  `git diff --cached` and look for keys (`S` + 55 characters is a Stellar secret seed), tokens and
  passwords. Check that generated files such as `.testnet-channel.env` are gitignored or contain
  only public ids (add them to `.gitignore` if not).
- Committing contract ids, wasm hashes, Testnet account **public** addresses and transaction hashes
  is correct and expected (they are public). Commit them under `deployments/` and in the README.
- Do not call any paid or third-party service, create accounts, or sign up for anything for the owner.

## Git rules

- Work on `main`. Make small commits, one logical change each, with an honest message (`fix(scripts):
  pass --source-account to stellar contract invoke`). Run the repo's full check before each commit.
- Do not backdate, squash to hide history, force-push, rewrite published history, open pull
  requests, or push tags/releases unless the owner asks. Releases are created by the owner in the GitHub UI
  with a **lowercase** tag such as `v0.1.0`, because the release workflows trigger on `v*`.
- Keep the author identity from the machine's git config. Follow any commit trailer your own tool
  requires. Never put a model name in code comments or docs.

## Workspace layout

The repos reference each other by relative path (`file:../Sideband-channels`, `../Unbound-stellar`,
`../Sideband-gateway`, ...), and several cross-repo tests are skipped when a sibling is missing. So the
sibling folder names must match the GitHub repo names exactly. Supported layouts:

```
A) one folder per project (4 repos)      B) one folder with all 12 repos
   Unbound/                                 workspace/
     Unbound-core/ Unbound-stellar/           Unbound-core/  Unbound-stellar/  Unbound-site/  Unbound-mobile/
     Unbound-site/ Unbound-mobile/            Torrent-api/   Torrent-contracts/ Torrent-indexer/ Torrent-web/
                                              Sideband-protocol/ Sideband-channels/ Sideband-gateway/ Sideband-mobile/
```

Detect with `pwd` and `ls ..`. For any sibling of **your project** that is missing, clone it next to
this repo: `git clone https://github.com/<Org>/<Repo> ../<Repo>` (orgs: `Unbound224`, `Torrent998`,
`Sideband34`). Never clone into, or modify, another project's repos unless the owner asks.
In layout B, work only on the project the owner names (or the repo you are standing in) and leave the
other projects alone.

## Tools to install first (check with `command -v`; ask the owner before installing anything global)

| Tool | Needed for | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| git, curl, jq, bash | everything | jq and curl are used by the deploy scripts |
| Node.js 22.13+ and npm | TypeScript repos | `node -v` |
| Rust stable + `rustup target add wasm32v1-none` | Soroban contracts | the old `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target is not used |
| stellar-cli 25.2 or newer (28.x recommended) | deploy and smoke scripts | see https://developers.stellar.org/docs/tools/cli/install-cli ; verify with `stellar --version` |
| Flutter stable (Dart 3.13+) | mobile repos | `flutter doctor`; Android toolchain only for APK builds |
| shellcheck | CI runs it on the scripts | optional locally |
| Playwright browsers | only for screenshots | optional |

If you build a contract with plain `cargo` (not `stellar contract build`) export
`SOROBAN_SDK_BUILD_SYSTEM_SUPPORTS_SPEC_SHAKING_V2=1`. `stellar contract build` is the canonical way
and does the spec shaking soroban-sdk 29 expects.

## Funding and keys on Testnet

```
stellar network ls                                   # testnet should be listed; add it if not
stellar keys generate --fund <alias> --network testnet   # creates a key in the local keystore and funds it with friendbot
stellar keys address <alias>                         # PUBLIC address, safe to print and commit
```

If friendbot is rate-limited, wait and retry; do not create keys with real funds. Aliases used by the
scripts are named in each project's runbook.

## Definition of done for every phase

A phase is done only when: the commands ran on this machine, their output is recorded in
`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` (date, command, ids/hashes, result), the repo's full check is green, the change is
committed and pushed to `main`, and CI on `main` is green (check the repo's Actions tab, or
`gh run list` if the GitHub CLI is installed).

## Project: Unbound (org `Unbound224`)

Unbound lets merchants issue store credit on Stellar that consumers can exchange and redeem. Soroban is
used in exactly one place, the **redemption escrow** (ADR 0002 in `Unbound-stellar`). Repos and roles:

| Repo | Role | Check command | Run for real |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Unbound-core` | Business API (TypeScript, SQLite): users, merchants, exchange, redemptions, disputes, jobs, admin | `npm run check` | `npm start` (port 3001) |
| `Unbound-stellar` | Stellar gateway service + Soroban contract `contracts/redemption-escrow` + XDR fixtures | `npm run check`; in `contracts/`: `cargo fmt --check && cargo clippy -- -D warnings && cargo test` | `scripts/deploy-testnet.sh`; gateway `npm start` (port 3002) |
| `Unbound-site` | Next.js landing page, merchant console, reviewer console (`/admin`), password-reset pages | `npm run check` | `npm run dev` (port 3000) |
| `Unbound-mobile` | Flutter consumer app: wallet, exchange, escrowed redemptions, backup/restore | `dart format --set-exit-if-changed . && flutter analyze --fatal-infos && flutter test` | `flutter run` |

Cross-repo tests need siblings with the exact folder names (`Unbound-core` <-> `Unbound-stellar` <->
`Unbound-site`); they skip silently when missing, so make sure they actually ran (look for skipped counts).

### Local continuation runbook (Unbound)

**Phase 0. Verify the baseline.** Pull and run every check in the table with all four repos side by side,
so cross-repo tests run instead of skipping. All must pass.

**Phase 1. Deploy the escrow contract to Testnet (Unbound-stellar).**
1. `rustup target add wasm32v1-none`; `stellar --version`.
2. `scripts/deploy-testnet.sh` (use `DRY_RUN=1` first to read the plan). It builds with
   `stellar contract build`, creates/funds the admin alias `unbound-escrow-admin` (override with `ADMIN`),
   deploys, calls `init` immediately, **reads the admin back and aborts if it is not yours**, and writes
   `contracts/deployments/testnet.json`. It has **never run for real**: fix real failures and rerun.
3. Issuer setup (the contract requires the escrow to be authorised for AUTH_REQUIRED credits and the
   issuer to be the asset's admin): create a Testnet issuer and a distributor with
   `stellar keys generate --fund`, issue a test credit (for example `SHOP`) with the classic Stellar
   operations (set `AUTH_REQUIRED`/`AUTH_REVOCABLE`, trustline, payment), then
   `AUTHORIZE_ASSET=SHOP:<ISSUER_G> ISSUER=<issuer-alias> scripts/deploy-testnet.sh authorize <CONTRACT_ID>`.
4. Write the missing `scripts/testnet-smoke.ts` (listed in `docs/CONTRIBUTOR_ISSUES.md`). It must drive, on
   Testnet, all four paths with real transactions and print hashes: `open_return` then `confirm`;
   `open_return` then `reject`; `open_return` then `expire_refund` after the shortest allowed deadline
   (1 hour: run it in the background and finish it later, or use the minimum and wait); single-use
   redemption id refused on replay; wrong signer refused. Assert escrow balance returns to zero. Save the
   hashes to `contracts/deployments/testnet-smoke.json`.
5. Record contract id, wasm hash, ledger, issuer/distributor public addresses and Stellar Expert Testnet
   links in the README "Deployments" section and `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`. Commit (public data only).

**Phase 2. Run the whole backend with the escrow on.**
1. Stellar gateway: copy `.env.example` to `.env`; set `GATEWAY_TOKEN` (fresh random), `ESCROW_CONTRACT_ID`,
   `SOROBAN_RPC_URL`, `HORIZON_URL`, `CORE_URL`, `CORE_TOKEN`. Start it. `SorobanRedemptionEscrow` has
   **never talked to Soroban RPC**: fix simulation/footprint/fee/auth problems this exposes, adding tests.
2. Core: `.env` with `STELLAR_GATEWAY_URL`, `STELLAR_GATEWAY_TOKEN` (same as `GATEWAY_TOKEN`),
   `STELLAR_ESCROW_ENABLED=true`, `ESCROW_WINDOW_HOURS`, `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (exact origins, e.g.
   `http://localhost:3000`), `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAIL`/`BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD` (dev only, never reuse a real
   password), `JOBS_ENABLED=true`. Run `npm run seed` (`scripts/seed-dev.ts`) for synthetic dev data.
3. End to end via curl/scripts: register a merchant, get it verified through the admin endpoints, issue
   credit, consumer exchange, redeem with escrow, merchant confirm/reject through the unsigned-transaction
   flow, then the expiry refund. Each step must be reflected on Testnet and in core's state. Fix everything
   that breaks; add regression tests.
4. Site: `.env.local` with `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=/core` and `CORE_PROXY_TARGET=http://127.0.0.1:3001`; run it
   and click through the merchant console and `/admin`.

**Phase 3. Mobile (HUMAN needed for the phone).** `flutter build apk --release` must succeed; fix any
Gradle/manifest issue and keep `.github/workflows/release.yml` consistent. Ask the owner to install the APK
(emulator API URL `http://10.0.2.2:3001`; real device needs the machine's LAN address) and run: create
wallet, back up the recovery key, restore, exchange, escrowed redemption, "Check status", "Take my credit
back" after the deadline. Collect errors, fix, add tests.

**Phase 4. Remaining engineering (in this order if time allows).** Browser-wallet (Freighter) signing for
the merchant escrow panel instead of paste-signed-XDR; a real email provider adapter for password reset
(the dev server only prints emails; choose a provider with the owner, read credentials from env); a
distributed lock for jobs; PostgreSQL option; MFA for admin; screenshot blocking on the backup screen.
Each needs tests, docs and a CHANGELOG line.

**Phase 5.** Produce the final checklist (last section).

### Unbound specifics for the final checklist

- Landing: Vercel project from `Unbound224/Unbound-site`, Root Directory blank, framework Next.js, env
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=/core` and `CORE_PROXY_TARGET=<public URL of the hosted core>`. The Android button already links
  to `https://github.com/Unbound224/Unbound-mobile/releases/latest/download/unbound-android.apk`; iOS stays
  "Coming soon". Leave `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_STORE_URL` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_PLAY_STORE_URL` unset until listings are live.
- Core and the Stellar gateway are long-running Node services (SQLite files, secrets): host on
  Render/Railway/Fly with a persistent disk; generate fresh `GATEWAY_TOKEN` and `STELLAR_GATEWAY_TOKEN`
  (identical value) and a strong bootstrap admin password; set `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to the Vercel URL.
- Release: the owner creates the release in the GitHub UI with a lowercase tag; the workflow builds
  `unbound-android.apk` + `.sha256` (debug-signed unless the four `ANDROID_*` secrets are set).
- Known gaps to state honestly: no real email provider, no MFA, no audit, escrow not yet signed through a browser
  wallet (unless you built it).

## Final checklist for the owner (the last thing you produce)

When the runbook phases are done, write `docs/OWNER_CHECKLIST.md` in the repo you are in (and print it in
the chat). Fill every `<...>` with the real value you obtained; remove items that no longer apply; keep the
steps that only the owner can do. Start with a short **status table** (phase, done/not done, evidence link).
Say honestly which items are still unverified. Include at least these sections, in this order:

1. **What is proven and what is not.** Contract ids and Testnet links, smoke-run results, tests, CI links.
   State plainly: no audit, Testnet only, which hardware or wallet paths were or were not tested.
2. **Releases (owner, GitHub UI).** For each mobile repo: Releases -> Draft a new release -> choose tag ->
   type a **lowercase** `vX.Y.Z` and "Create new tag on publish" -> target `main` -> tick "Set as the latest
   release" -> Publish -> wait for the `release` workflow (about 10 to 15 minutes) -> open the
   `/releases/latest/download/<name>-android.apk` link on a phone to confirm it downloads.
3. **Android signing (optional).** `keytool -genkey -v -keystore release.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048
   -validity 10000 -alias upload`; `base64 -w0 release.jks`; add repository secrets `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64`,
   `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS`, `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD` to the mobile repo. Keep the
   keystore backed up and never commit it.
4. **Vercel (landing page).** vercel.com -> sign in with GitHub, allow the org -> Add New -> Project ->
   import the repo -> set **Root Directory** exactly as in the project section above (Edit button next to
   Root Directory) -> framework Next.js -> add the environment variables for Production (project section)
   -> Deploy -> open the live URL and click every link and the download button. Then put the URL in the
   repo's Website field and the org profile. Docs: https://vercel.com/docs/monorepos
5. **Backends (if the project has one).** Create a Render, Railway or Fly service per Node service with a
   persistent disk for SQLite; paste the environment variables (generated secrets, never from the repo);
   check the health endpoint; set CORS and proxy variables to the Vercel URL; redeploy the landing page
   with the final backend URL.
6. **GitHub org and repo settings.** Per org: upload the avatar (`brand/org-avatar.png`); create a public
   `.github` repo with `profile/README.md` copied from `brand/ORG_PROFILE.md`. Per repo: Settings -> Code
   security -> enable private vulnerability reporting, Dependabot alerts and secret scanning; add topics
   (`stellar`, `soroban`, `drips-wave` plus the domain); add the website URL; pin the main repos.
7. **Drips Wave application.** Read the current maintainer steps at https://www.drips.network/wave , then:
   apply with the project's main repos; create real GitHub issues from `docs/CONTRIBUTOR_ISSUES.md` (clear
   scope, acceptance test, labels as Wave's docs require); complete any identity/KYC Drips asks for;
   describe the project truthfully using section 1.
8. **Store listings (optional, later).** Google Play developer account (one-time fee) and a signed app
   bundle; Apple Developer Program and a Mac for iOS builds. Only after a listing is live, set
   `NEXT_PUBLIC_PLAY_STORE_URL` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_STORE_URL` on Vercel (https URLs on
   `play.google.com` / `apps.apple.com`) so the real badges appear. Until then the landing page correctly
   says "Coming soon" for iOS.
9. **Before Mainnet (not part of this application).** Independent security audit, a bug bounty, legal review,
   key-management plan. Do not describe the project as production-ready before this.
10. **Hand-back.** If anything in 1 to 9 fails, send the error text (never keys or seed phrases) back to a
    coding agent in this repo and tell it to read `AGENTS.md`.

Do not tick any item for the owner. Do not ask the owner for secrets: they type secrets only into
Vercel/Render/GitHub settings pages themselves.
